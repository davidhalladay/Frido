# *Frido*: Feature Pyramid Diffusion for Complex Scene Image Synthesis


This is the official repository of [Frido](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13753). We now support training and testing for text-to-image, layout-to-image, scene-graph-to-image, and label-to-image on COCO/VG/OpenImage. Please stay tune there!

## ☀️Important updates 
- [Nov 7, 2024] Microsoft’s blob storage no longer allow anonymous downloads per the latest company wise security policy. The pretrained-weights may not be available now. We are fixing this issues.

## ☀️News

We provide a web version of demo [here](https://sites.google.com/view/wancyuanfan/projects/frido) to help researchers to better understand our work. This web demo contains multiple animations to explain th diffusion and denoising processes of **Frido** and more qualitative experimental results. Hope it's useful!

> *The mini-versions are for quick testing and reproducing, which can be done within 1 hours on 1*V100. High FID is expected. To evaluate generation quality, full validation / test split needs to be run.*

> *FID scores were evaluated by using [torch-fidelity](https://github.com/toshas/torch-fidelity). The scores may slightly fluctuate due to the inherent initial random noise of diffusion models.*

## 🌲Inference Frido
We now provide scripts for testing Frido. 

### Quick Start
Please checkout the jupyter notebook [`demo.ipynb`](https://github.com/davidhalladay/Frido/blob/main/demo.ipynb) for a simple demo on text-to-image generation for COCO.


Once the datasets and model weights are properly set up, one may test Frido by the following commands.
### Text-to-image 
```bash
# for full validation:
bash tools/frido/eval_t2i.sh

# for mini-val:
bash tools/frido/eval_t2i_minival.sh

```
 - Default output folder will be `exp/t2i/frido_f16f8/samples`
### Layout-to-image

```bash
# for full validation:
bash tools/frido/eval_layout2i.sh

# for mini-val:
bash tools/frido/eval_layout2i_minival.sh
```
Default output folder will be `exp/layout2i/frido_f8f4/samples`

(Optional) You can modify the script by adding following augments. 

- -o [OUTPUT_PATH]  :  to change the output folder path.

- -c [INT]  :  number of steps for ddim and fastdpm sampling. (default=200)

### Multi-GPU testing

We provide code for multiple GPUs testing. Please refer to scripts of [`tools/eval_t2i_multiGPU.sh`](https://github.com/davidhalladay/Frido/blob/main/tools/eval_t2i_multiGPU.sh)

For example, 4-gpu inference can be run by the following.

```bash
bash eval_t2i_multiGPU.sh 4
```

---

## 🌱Train Frido
We provide some sample scripts for training Frido.

Once the datasets and model weights are properly set up, one may test Frido by the following commands.
### MS-VQGAN
```bash
bash tools/msvqgan/train_msvqgan_f16f8_coco.sh
```
 - Default output folder will be `exp_my/msvqgan/logs/msvqgan_f16f8_coco`
 - The sample script is tested on single V100. Please modify the batch-size and learning rate if using other types of GPU.
### Frido

```bash
bash tools/frido/train_t2i_f16f8_coco.sh
```
- Default output folder will be `exp_my/frido/t2i/logs/frido_f16f8_coco`

(Optional) You can modify the script by adding following augments. **bold** denotes default settings.
- -t [True/**False**] : to switch between training and testing mode. Note that this only support testing without classifier-free guidance (CFG). For CFG testing, please refer to [inference frido](#inference-frido).
- -log_dir [LOG_DIR_PATH] : to change the logs folder path.
- -scale_lr [**True**/False] : to allow model to auto-adjust learning rate by the total GPUs you used.
- -autoresume [**True**/False] : to enable auto-resume if detect existing checkpoints in log_dir.
- -save_top_k [INT] : Only save top K of model checkpoints based on monitor setting in the config. (default: **10**)
### Multi-GPU training

For multi-GPU training, please modify the augmentation of ```--gpus``` in the training scripts as follows.

For *single* GPU training, 
```bash
python main.py --base [CONFIGS] -t True --gpus 1 -log_dir [LOG_DIR] -n [EXP_NAME]
```
For *8* GPUs training, 
```bash
python main.py --base [CONFIGS] -t True --gpus 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 -log_dir [LOG_DIR] -n [EXP_NAME]
```

---

## Evaluation
### FID & SceneFID
FID scores were evaluated by using [torch-fidelity](https://github.com/toshas/torch-fidelity).

After running inference, FID score can be computed by the following command:
```bash
fidelity --gpu 0 --fid --input2 [GT_FOLDER] --input1 [PRED_FOLDER]
```
Example:
```bash
fidelity --gpu 0 --fid --input2 exp/t2i/frido_f16f8/samples/.../img/inputs --input1 exp/t2i/frido_f16f8/samples/.../img/sample
```
### CLIPscore

Please refer to EMNLP 2021 CLIPScore.

- paper: [CLIPScore: A Reference-free Evaluation Metric for Image Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08718) 
- GitHub:
[clipscore](https://github.com/jmhessel/clipscore)

### Detection score (YOLO)

We use YOLOv4 as pre-trained detector to calculate the detection score. Please refer to YOLOv4
- paper [YOLOv4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10934)
- GitHub: [darknet](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet) 

### IS/Precision/Recall

We use the scripts in ADM to calculate the IS, precision, and recall. 
- paper [ADM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.0523).
- GitHub: [guided-diffusion](https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion) 

### PSNR/SSIM

To evaluate the reconstruction performance, we use the [PSNR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_signal-to-noise_ratio) and [SSIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity). The scripts can be found in the following python packages.
- GitHub: [image-similarity-measures](https://github.com/up42/image-similarity-measures)
